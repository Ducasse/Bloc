I am a collection of examples that show conversions from SVG files to Bloc objects.

Once you click on an example, you can click on "inspectLastConverted" to inspect the BlElement resulting from the conversion.

For now, use 'Cairo' as the preferable host for Bloc to display these examples properly.
