I represent an abstract key combination which is the most important part of ===BlShortcut===.
I define an event matching API that allows ===BlShortcutHandler=== to find the most appropriate shortcut for currently pressed keys.

I have support of Visitor pattern. See ===BlKeyCombinationVisitor===

See ===BlKeyCombinationExamples=== for related examples.
