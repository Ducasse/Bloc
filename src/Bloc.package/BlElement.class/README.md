I manages children using a layout strategy and can be resizeable.
By default  i am drawn as a rectangle but i can be made to use any geometry by specifying the geometry property. The geometry is only used to define the geometry to be drawn and the interaction area.

I am the superclass to create widgets.

I have the following propeties:

 - opacity - defines transparency degree of an element and takes a value in range [ 0...1 ]. Opacity influences children too, meaning that the whole element including its children will become transparent
