I represent an element elevation given in the same units as width and height.
Elevation allows us to achieve very advanced rendering effects that is not possible with z-index.

Taking elevation into account forces us to have a separate composition rendering tree which is different from an element's structure tree.

Note: Elevation is not influenced by transformation matrix!
