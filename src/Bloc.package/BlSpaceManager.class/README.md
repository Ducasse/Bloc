I am a Universe space manager.

I contain Bloc spaces, can add or remove them. I am also responsible for sending pulses(tick) messages to spaces I know.

I am used by Universe in order to provide support of multiple spaces within the Universe.

- addSpace: add a space
- removeSpace: remove a given space
- clear close all spaces
- pulse send pulse message to all spaces

   One simple example is simply gorgeous.
