I am a rectangular geometry with support of rounded corners.

I can play a role of a square if both width and height are equal. In this case can be created using a predefined factory method:

	BlRectangle length: 20 "creates a square with side length of 20"
	
In order to explicitely create a rectangle use extent:

	BlRectangle extent: 50@30 "create a rectangle with width 50 and height 30"
