I am a special type of event handler designed to handle keyboard events in order to detect when it is time to perform a shortcut action.
All defined shortcuts are stored in ===BlShortcutRegistry=== which can be accessed using #shortcutRegistry.

I am a part of ===BlSimpleEventDispatcher=== which is a default event dispatcher in ===BlElement===
