I represent an abstract layout direction.

There are left-to-right (LTR) and right-to-left (RTL) languages. Language direction influences the alignement of elments within layouts.
I do not have any logic and can only used as direction flag. Layouts that have direction specific logic should impelment their own object oriented mechanism
