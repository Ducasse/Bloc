[DEPRECATED @see BlPulseService ]
I am the Bloc main loop.
I indicate to the Universe that is time to synchronize the state of the elements. 

A pulse is fired all the 16ms to obtain 60 frames per second (fps) maximum.
The opened spaces listen the pulse to be synchronized and to update their state when it is needed.
