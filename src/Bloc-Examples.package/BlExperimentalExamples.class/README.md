I contain experimental examples that only work in manually prepared laboratory environments.

Trying to run these examples may result in undefined bahaviour such as: crash, infinite debugger windows spawning, unresponsive image, universe collapse or suddenly created black hole that will probably destroy our solar system.

Take care. Be conscious at all times.
