I am an infinite item animator.

I am responsible for keeping track of item's animation. In case of infinite elements we need to end animation as soon as item goes away and in some cases depending on configuration start on-appear animation when item comes in.

Public API and Key Messages

- endAnimation: ends animation of provided item.

   One simple example is simply gorgeous.
