hooks - scrolling
onScrolled: aPoint
	"Sent when the scroll position of this InfiniteElement changes. Subclasses should use
	this method to respond to scrolling within the datasource's data set instead of an explicit event handler.
	I will always be invoked before event handlers. If a subclass needs to perform any additional upkeep
	or bookkeeping after scrolling but before events fired, this is a good place to do so"
