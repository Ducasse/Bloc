text - copying
copyFrom: aStartIndex to: anEndIndex
	"Create a copy of this text within a given indices interval.
	Note: I am different from ==#from:to:== in a sense that I don't create a sub-text that points
	to the original text, I create an independent copy which can be safely used in text editors and other tools.
	
	README: For compatibility reasons with the rest of the system we allow aStartIndex to be bigger than anEndIndex and also bigger than self size."
