I represent a part of original text from ===start=== to ===end===.
All subtexts of a BrText share the same text instance.
I modify the underlying text when I am modified.

Essentially, I offer a scope that can be used  by upper layers, such as editors, to make it easier to manipulate a logical piece of text, such as a line, or a paragraph.
