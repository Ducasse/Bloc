I am a triangular arrow head.
My size depends on the width of a curve and hence can not be manually specified.

It is possible to have a border around triangle by specifying a border width of a triangle arrowhead.

I support background and border paints.
 - For hollow arrowhead let background be transparent.
 - For solid arrowhead make background paint be the same as border paint.
 	(it is possible to specify different paints for border and background)
