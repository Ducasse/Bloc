I am a circlular arrow head.
My border width depends on the width of a curve and hence can not be manually specified.

I support background and border paints.
 - For hollow arrowhead let background be transparent.
 - For solid arrowhead make background paint be the same as border paint.
 	(it is possible to specify different paints for border and background)
